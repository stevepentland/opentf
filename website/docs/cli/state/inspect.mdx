# Inspecting State

OpenTofu includes some commands for reading and updating state without taking
any other actions.

- [The `tofu state list` command](../commands/state/list.mdx)
  shows the resource addresses for every resource OpenTofu knows about in a
  configuration, optionally filtered by partial resource address.

- [The `tofu state show` command](../commands/state/show.mdx)
  displays detailed state data about one resource.

- [The `tofu refresh` command](../commands/refresh.mdx) updates
  state data to match the real-world condition of the managed resources. This is
  done automatically during plans and applies, but not when interacting with
  state directly.
