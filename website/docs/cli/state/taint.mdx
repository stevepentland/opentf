# Forcing Re-creation of Resources

During planning, by default OpenTofu retrieves the latest state of each
existing object and compares it with the current configuration, planning
actions only against objects whose current state does not match the
configuration.

However, in some cases a remote object may become damaged or degraded in a
way that OpenTofu cannot automatically detect. For example, if software
running inside a virtual machine crashes but the virtual machine itself is
still running then OpenTofu will typically have no way to detect and respond
to the problem, because OpenTofu only directly manages the machine as a whole.

If you know that an object is damaged, or if you want to force OpenTofu to
replace it for any other reason, you can override OpenTofu's default behavior
using [the `-replace=...` planning option](../commands/plan.mdx#replace-address)
when you run either `tofu plan` or `tofu apply`:

```shellsession
$ tofu apply -replace="aws_instance.example"
# ...

  # aws_instance.example will be replaced, as requested
-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...
    }
```

## The "tainted" status

Sometimes OpenTofu is able to infer automatically that an object is in an
incomplete or degraded state. For example, if creation of a complex object
fails in such a way that parts of it already exist in the remote system, or
if object creation succeeded but a provisioner step subsequently failed,
OpenTofu must remember that the object exists but may not be fully-functional.

OpenTofu represents this situation by marking an object in the state as
"tainted". When an object is marked with this status, the next plan will force
replacing that object in a similar way to if you had specified that object's
address using `-replace=...` as described above.

```
  # aws_instance.example is tainted, so it must be replaced
-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...
    }
```

If OpenTofu has marked an object as tainted but you consider it to be working
correctly and do not want to replace it, you can override OpenTofu's
determination using [the `tofu untaint` command](../commands/untaint.mdx),
after which OpenTofu will consider the object to be ready for use by any
downstream resource declarations.

You can also _force_ OpenTofu to mark a particular object as tainted using
[the `tofu taint` command](../commands/taint.mdx), but that approach is
deprecated in favor of the `-replace=...` option, which avoids the need to
create an interim state snapshot with a tainted object.
