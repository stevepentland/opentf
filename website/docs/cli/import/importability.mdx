# Resource Importability

Each resource in OpenTofu must implement some basic logic to become
importable. As a result, you cannot import all OpenTofu resources.

Please reference the provider's specific documentation on which
resources can be imported.  If you have issues importing a
resource, report an issue in the relevant provider repository.

OpenTofu supports all providers through the Terraform Plugin SDK. To
make a resource importable, refer to the [Terraform Plugin SDK Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/import).
