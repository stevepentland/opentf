# `filesha512` Function

`filesha512` is a variant of [`sha512`](../../language/functions/sha512.mdx)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `sha512(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](../../language/functions/file.mdx) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
