# `base64gzip` Function

`base64gzip` compresses a string with gzip and then encodes the result in
Base64 encoding.

OpenTofu uses the "standard" Base64 alphabet as defined in
[RFC 4648 section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4).

Strings in the OpenTofu language are sequences of unicode characters rather
than bytes, so this function will first encode the characters from the string
as UTF-8, then apply gzip compression, and then finally apply Base64 encoding.

While we do not recommend manipulating large, raw binary data in the OpenTofu
language, this function can be used to compress reasonably sized text strings
generated within the OpenTofu language. For example, the result of this
function can be used to create a compressed object in Amazon S3 as part of
an S3 website.

  and returns its raw bytes with Base64 encoding.
