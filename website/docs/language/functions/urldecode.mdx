# `urldecode` Function

`urldecode` targets encoded characters within a string. 

The function is capable of decoding a comprehensive range of characters, 
including those outside the ASCII range. Non-ASCII characters are first treated as UTF-8 bytes,
followed by the application of percent decoding to each byte, 
facilitating the accurate decoding of multibyte characters.


## Examples

```
> urldecode("Hello+World%21")
Hello World!
> urldecode("%E2%98%83")
â˜ƒ
> urldecode("foo%3Abar%40localhost%3Ffoo%3Dbar%26bar%3Dbaz")
foo:bar@localhost?foo=bar&bar=baz
```
