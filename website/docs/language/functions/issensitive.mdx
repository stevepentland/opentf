# `issensitive` Function

`issensitive` takes any value and returns `true` if the value is marked as
sensitive, and `false` otherwise.

The `issensitive` function might be useful if you need to programmatically
determine whether or not a value is sensitive, for example if you have a value
containing both sensitive and non-sensitive values and you need to separate the
two parts:

```hcl
variable "environment_variables" {
  description = "A list of environment variables that may contain both sensitive and non-sensitive values"
  type        = map(string)
  sensitive   = true
}

locals {
  sensitive_variables = [for key, value in var.environment_variables: key if issensitive(value)]
  nonsensitive_variables = [for key, value in var.environment_variables: key if !issensitive(value)]
}
```

## Examples

```
> issensitive(1)
false
> issensitive("hello")
false
> issensitive(sensitive("hello"))
true
```
