# Variables and Outputs

The OpenTofu language includes a few kinds of blocks for requesting or
publishing named values.

- [Input Variables](../../language/values/variables.mdx) serve as parameters for
  a module, so users can customize behavior without editing the source.

- [Output Values](../../language/values/outputs.mdx) are like return values for a module.

- [Local Values](../../language/values/locals.mdx) are a convenience feature for
  assigning a short name to an expression.
