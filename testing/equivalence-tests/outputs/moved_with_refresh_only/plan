tfcoremock_simple_resource.second: Refreshing state... [id=70c47571-66c3-b1dc-2474-47a74b9c7886]

Note: Objects have changed outside of OpenTofu

OpenTofu detected the following changes made outside of OpenTofu since the
last "tofu apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.first has moved to tfcoremock_simple_resource.second
    resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "second" {
        id     = "70c47571-66c3-b1dc-2474-47a74b9c7886"
        # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
    }


This is a refresh-only plan, so OpenTofu will not take any actions to undo
these. If you were expecting these changes then you can apply this plan to
record the updated values in the OpenTofu state without changing any remote
objects.
