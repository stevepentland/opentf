tfcoremock_simple_resource.drift: Refreshing state... [id=cb79269e-dc39-1e68-0a9c-63cb392afda9]

Note: Objects have changed outside of OpenTofu

OpenTofu detected the following changes made outside of OpenTofu since the
last "tofu apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # tfcoremock_simple_resource.drift has changed
  ~ resource "tfcoremock_simple_resource" "drift" {
        id     = "cb79269e-dc39-1e68-0a9c-63cb392afda9"
      ~ string = "Hello, world!" -> "Hello, drift!"
    }


This is a refresh-only plan, so OpenTofu will not take any actions to undo
these. If you were expecting these changes then you can apply this plan to
record the updated values in the OpenTofu state without changing any remote
objects.

Saved the plan to: equivalence_test_plan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    tofu apply "equivalence_test_plan"
